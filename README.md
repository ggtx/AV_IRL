#### Predicting Autonomous Vehicles Behaviour in Unknown Environments Using Inverse Reinforcement Learning
- This project initially trained an expert agent using the PPO algorithm, with the filename being "airl_expert_ppo_training.py". 
- Subsequently, using the IRL algorithm, both AIRL and GAIL were employed to train several learner models, with filenames "airl_train_loop.py" and "gail_train_loop.py" respectively. 
- Lastly, the "final_eval.py" file was utilised to validate the safety, rewards, and correlation of the learner's actions with that of the expert's.
